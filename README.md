# IBM HR Analytics: Employee Attrition Prediction

This project analyzes the IBM HR Analytics dataset to understand the key drivers behind employee attrition and to develop predictive models that can help organizations reduce turnover.

## üìä Problem Statement

**Attrition** (employee departure) is a significant concern for HR departments. High attrition increases costs and affects team morale and productivity. This project aims to:

- Analyze attrition patterns and risk factors.
- Build predictive models to forecast attrition.
- Generate actionable business insights.

## üîç Dataset

- **Source**: [IBM HR Analytics Attrition & Performance](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset)
- **Target Variable**: `Attrition` (Yes/No)

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Workflow

### 1. **Data Preprocessing**
- Handled missing values and encoded categorical variables.
- Addressed class imbalance using **SMOTE**.

### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Identified high-risk roles and departments.
- Analyzed correlations with job satisfaction, age, income, etc.

### 3. **Model Building**
- Built and evaluated:
  - **Random Forest Classifier**
  - **XGBoost Classifier**
- Used **stratified train-test split** for balanced evaluation.

### 4. **Model Evaluation**
- Metrics used:
  - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
  - Confusion Matrix
  - ROC-AUC Curve

### 5. **Feature Importance & Explainability**
- Identified top 5 drivers of attrition using feature importance plots.
- Focus on **OverTime**, **Job Satisfaction**, **Age**, **Income**, **Years at Company**.

---

## üß† Key Findings

- **OverTime** is the strongest indicator of attrition.
- Younger employees and those with low job satisfaction are more likely to leave.
- High attrition in the **Sales** and **Human Resources** departments.

---

## üí° Business Recommendations

- Reduce excessive overtime and improve work-life balance.
- Prioritize satisfaction initiatives and surveys.
- Focus on early-tenure employees (first 1-3 years).
- Review compensation for fairness and competitiveness.
